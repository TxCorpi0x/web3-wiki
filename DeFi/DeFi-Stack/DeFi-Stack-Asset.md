# Asset Layer

The asset layer comprises the digital assets that are native to or issued on the blockchain. These assets represent value and are used within DeFi protocols.

## Types of Assets

- **Native Tokens:** The native cryptocurrency of a blockchain (e.g., ETH on Ethereum, SOL on Solana).
- **Tokenized Assets:** Representations of real-world assets or other cryptocurrencies on a blockchain.
  - **Stablecoins:** Cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar (e.g., USDC, DAI).
  - **Wrapped Tokens:** Representations of cryptocurrencies from other blockchains (e.g., Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Ethereum).
  - **NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens):** Unique digital assets that represent ownership of items such as art, collectibles, or virtual land.

## Use Cases in DeFi

- **Collateral:** Assets used to secure loans in lending and borrowing protocols.
- **Trading:** Assets exchanged on decentralized exchanges (DEXs).
- **Yield Farming:** Assets staked in DeFi protocols to earn rewards.
- **Governance:** Assets used to participate in the governance of DeFi protocols.
