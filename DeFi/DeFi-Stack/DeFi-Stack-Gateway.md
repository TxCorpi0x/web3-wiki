# Gateway Layer

The Gateway Layer in the DeFi stack provides users with access points to decentralized financial services. These gateways abstract away the complexities of interacting directly with protocols, making DeFi more accessible.

## Key Components

- **Wallets:** Software or hardware that allows users to store, manage, and transact with their digital assets.
- **Dashboards:** Web interfaces that provide users with an overview of their DeFi portfolio, including holdings, positions, and performance.
- **dApp / Browser Interfaces:** Platforms that allow users to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) through a web browser.
- **On-Ramp Platforms:** Services that allow users to convert fiat currency into cryptocurrency, enabling them to participate in DeFi.
- **Web3 APIs/SDKs:** Tools that allow developers to build applications that interact with blockchain networks and DeFi protocols.

## Examples

- **Wallets:** MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Ledger, Trezor
- **Dashboards:** Zapper, DeBank
- **dApp / Browser Interfaces:** Brave Browser, Coinbase Wallet
- **On-Ramp Platforms:** Coinbase, Kraken, Binance
