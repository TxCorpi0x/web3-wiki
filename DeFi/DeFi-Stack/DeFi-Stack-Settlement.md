# Settlement Layer (Base Layer)

The settlement layer is the foundation of the DeFi stack. It provides the underlying blockchain infrastructure where transactions are recorded and smart contracts are executed.

## Key Characteristics

- **Security:** Provides a secure and tamper-proof environment for transactions.
- **Decentralization:** Operates without a central authority, ensuring censorship resistance.
- **Consensus Mechanism:** Uses a consensus algorithm (e.g., Proof-of-Stake, Proof-of-Work) to validate transactions and maintain the integrity of the blockchain.
- **Smart Contract Execution:** Supports the execution of smart contracts, which are the building blocks of DeFi applications.

## Examples

- **Ethereum:** The most widely used blockchain for DeFi, known for its robust smart contract capabilities and large developer community.
- **Solana:** A high-performance blockchain that offers fast transaction speeds and low fees, making it suitable for DeFi applications that require high throughput.
- **Avalanche:** A blockchain platform that allows for the creation of custom blockchains and decentralized applications.
- **Binance Smart Chain (BSC):** A blockchain that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and offers lower transaction fees than Ethereum.

## Further Considerations

- **Scalability:** The ability of the settlement layer to handle a large number of transactions is crucial for the growth of DeFi.
- **Interoperability:** The ability of the settlement layer to interact with other blockchains is important for creating a more connected and efficient DeFi ecosystem.
- **Governance:** The governance mechanisms of the settlement layer can impact the evolution and development of DeFi.
