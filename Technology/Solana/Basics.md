# Solana Basics

## Special Concepts in Solana

- **Proof of History (PoH):** A consensus mechanism that provides a way to cryptographically verify the passage of time, enabling faster transaction ordering and consensus.
- **Tower BFT:** Solana's implementation of Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT), optimized for PoH.
- **Turbine:** A block propagation protocol that allows Solana to stream data efficiently to validators.
- **Gulf Stream:** A transaction forwarding protocol that pushes transaction caching and forwarding to the edge of the network.
- **Sealevel:** A parallel transaction processing engine that allows thousands of smart contracts to run concurrently.
- **Pipelining:** A Transaction Processing Unit for optimizing validation.
- **Cloudbreak:** A horizontally scaled accounts database.
- **Archivers:** A network for distributed ledger storage.
