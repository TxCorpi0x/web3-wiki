# Tokenomics

Tokenomics is the study of the economics of a cryptocurrency or token. It encompasses all the qualities that affect a cryptocurrency's supply and demand, including its creation, distribution, and usage. It's essentially the design and management of a cryptocurrency's economy.

## Strategies

- [Deflationary Tokenomics](./strategies/deflationary.md): A portion of tokens are burned or otherwise removed from circulation, aiming to increase scarcity and potentially drive up value.
- [Inflationary Tokenomics](./strategies/inflationary.md): New tokens are regularly introduced into the supply, often used to reward staking or other network participation.
- [Dual Token Model](./strategies/tokenomics.dual-token.md): Using two tokens, one for utility and one for governance, to separate concerns and potentially optimize each token's behavior.
- [Staking Rewards](./strategies/staking.md): Rewarding token holders for locking up their tokens to support the network, reducing circulating supply and incentivizing long-term holding.
- [Utility-Based Tokenomics](./strategies/utility-based.md): The token has a specific use case within the platform or ecosystem, driving demand based on the platform's usage.
- [Revenue Sharing](./strategies/revenue-sharing.md): Distributing a portion of the platform's revenue to token holders, aligning incentives and potentially increasing the token's value.
- [Bonding Curve](./strategies/bonding-curve.md): Using a mathematical formula to determine the price of a token based on its supply, creating continuous liquidity and price discovery.
- [DAO Governance](./strategies/dao-governance.md): Empowering token holders to participate in the governance of the project, giving them a say in its future direction.
